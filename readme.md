## Introduction
This is a simple school project hosting github page. It's mainly use to upload and also attach the lessons that we learn everyday.

## Folder Structure
```
/assets               # A place containing the images and etc.
/.vscode              # A vscode config file for live server
```
So mainly I use the assets folder in order to store every picture and other documents which serve as an asset in it while the .vscode folder is simply a config file generated by vscode.
